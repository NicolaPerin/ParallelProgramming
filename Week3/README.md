## Distributed matrix multiplication
The first goal is to multiply two matrices A and B that are distributed along the first dimension (rows) across several MPI processes. We need to perform the dot product between each row of A and each column of B. The rows of A are already local to the processes, but the columns of B are not. To reconstruct the columns of B we create a datatype and perform an MPI_Allgatherv() type of communication, so that each process receives the columns it needs. 
We also take care of the possible remainders when the number of processes is not a divisor of the size of the matrix. To do so, the datatype has to be recreated at each iteration of the loop over the number of column blocks.
